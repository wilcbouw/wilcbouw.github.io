# Linter configuration for YAML files.  This tool uses a predefined set of
# rules to check source files for issues such as line length, trailing spaces,
# and indentation.  It is available as a Python based command line tool and can
# also integrate with your editor to display diagnostics like warnings or
# errors from the YAML language server.  These diagnostics are based on the
# rules defined in this configuration file.  For more information about, refer
# to the official source code repository at:
#
#       https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint/
#
# The rules are still a work in progress and subject to change.  I still need
# to think about this configuration, and for now this is a base template.
