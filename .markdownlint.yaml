# Linter configuration for Markdown and CommonMark files.  This tool is a style
# checker that uses a predefined set of rules to check source files for issues
# such as line length, trailing spaces, indention and more to check and format
# files based on the CommonMark specification.  It is available as command line
# tool and work with Prettier for formatting.  It can also integrate with your
# editor to display diagnostics like warnings or errors from the Markdown
# language server.  These diagnostics are based on the rules defined in this
# configuration file.  For more information about, refer to the official source
# code repository at:
#
#       https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/
#
# The rules are still a work in progress and subject to change.  I still need
# to think about this configuration, and for now this is a base template.
