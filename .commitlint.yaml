#
# Linter configuration for rules on commit messages that are checked on pull
# requests, and before push to origin from local reposiotry.  These rules are
# used to check if the commit message contains a type.  The type is the first
# word in the commit message and must match one of the types defined in the
# types array in this configuration file.  For more information about, refer to
# the official documentation at:
#
#       https://commitlint.js.org/reference/rules.html
#
# The rules are still a work in progress and subject to change.  I still need
# to think about this configuration, and for now this is a base template.

# Base config for conventional commit messages
